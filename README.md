## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Familiarity with Python or JavaScript
- A curious mind! 🧠

## 📝 Overview

Welcome to Day 1 of your Agentics journey! Today we'll explore the fundamental question: **What exactly is an AI Agent?**

### Definition

An **AI Agent** is an autonomous system that:
1. **Perceives** its environment through inputs (text, images, data)
2. **Reasons** about what actions to take
3. **Acts** upon the environment using tools
4. **Learns** from feedback to improve future actions

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | Makes decisions without constant human intervention |
| **Goal-Oriented** | Works toward achieving specific objectives |
| **Reactive** | Responds to changes in the environment |
| **Proactive** | Takes initiative to achieve goals |
| **Tool Use** | Utilizes external tools and APIs |

### The Agent Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│    Observe → Think → Act → Observe → ...   │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Agents Matter

Traditional LLMs are powerful but **stateless** and **passive**. Agents transform LLMs into:
- Active problem solvers
- Persistent workers
- Tool-wielding assistants
- Autonomous decision makers

## 📖 Reading Materials

1. [Anthropic: Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
2. [LangChain: What is an Agent?](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#agents)
3. [OpenAI: Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)

## ✅ Activity: Your First Agent Concept

Create a file called `day1-agent-concept.md` in your repository describing:

1. A real-world problem an agent could solve
2. What inputs the agent would receive
3. What tools it would need
4. What actions it would take

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# My Agent Concept

## Problem
[Describe a problem]

## Inputs
- [Input 1]
- [Input 2]

## Tools Needed
- [Tool 1]
- [Tool 2]

## Actions
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
```
